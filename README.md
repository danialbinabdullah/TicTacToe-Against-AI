### Introduction
Tic Tac Toe is a classic game where two players take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game. This project provides a digital implementation of the game, allowing users to play against each other or against an AI.

### Features

- Game Status Display: The game status is displayed, indicating whose turn it is or if there's a winner.
- Log Box: A log box displays the actions taken during the game, including moves made by the AI.
- AI Opponent: Utilizes OpenAI's GPT-3 model to provide an AI opponent for single-player mode.
